# ToDoApp

## For this mini-project, weâ€™ll create a simple To-Do List application 
## with both Python and C++ versions.
## This project will give hands-on experience in Git for version control
## while applying programming basics.

### This is the first mini project in a series of mini projects in order to learn genral interesting and important subjects for me.
